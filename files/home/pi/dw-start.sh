# Pre-modified version of dw-start.sh for headless CLI setup.
# Original: https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/blob/master/dw-start.sh
# Changes:
# - remove RUNMODE to force CLI always (helps for testing), remove GUI function
# - set DWCMD for CLI mode with RTL-SDR, create a separate file to pass to screen to work with Buster
# - remove initial sleep wait since we don't care about desktop
# - added logs to CLI command that pipe to LOGFILE instead of ignored.

# Run this from crontab periodically to start up
# Dire Wolf automatically.

# Location of the direwolf binary.  Depends on $PATH as shown.
# change this if you want to use some other specific location.
# e.g.  DIREWOLF="/usr/local/bin/direwolf"

DIREWOLF="direwolf"

#Direwolf start up command :: two examples where example one is enabled
#
# 1. For normal operation as TNC, digipeater, IGate, etc.
#    Print audio statistics each 100 seconds for troubleshooting.
#    Change this command to however you wish to start Direwolf
#DWCMD="$DIREWOLF -a 100"

#---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 2. Alternative for running with SDR receiver.
#    Piping one application into another makes it a little more complicated.
#    We need to use bash for the | to be recognized.
DWCMD="/home/pi/rtl-dw-start.sh"

# Where will logs go - needs to be writable by non-root users
